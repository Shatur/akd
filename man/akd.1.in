.SH SYNOPSIS

.B @PROJECT_NAME@
[options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Advanced Keyboard Daemon
is a small and efficient keyboard daemon for X11 written in C++17.

.SH OPTIONS

.SS Commands

You can specify only one command at a time. Any of this parameters are incompatible with \fBCommands\fR

Print usage information and exit.

.TP
.B "-v, --version"
Print version number and exit.

.TP
.B "-c, --print-current-group"
Print current group and exit.

.TP
.B "-d, --print-current-group-index"
Print current group index and exit.

.TP
.B "-x, --next-group"
Switch to the next group and exit.

.TP
.BI "-i, --set-group=" "index"
Switch group to the specified index.

.SS Settings

.TP
.BI "-s, --settings=" "[~/.config/akd/akd.conf]"
Path to settings file.

.SS Daemon configuration

Any of this parameters are incompatible with \fBCommands\fR

.TP
.B "-g, --general.different-groups"
Use different groups for each window.

.TP
.B "-a, --general.different-layout"
Use different layouts for each window.

.TP
.B "-p, --general.print-groups"
Print switched languages in stdout.

.TP
.BI "-l, --general.layouts=" "layout[...]"
Languages separated by ','. Can be specified several times to define several layouts.

.TP
.B "-e, --general.default-group"
The index of the group to switch when changing the layout.

.TP
.B "--general.skip-rules"
Do not update keyboard rules. Improves performance, but other applications won't be aware of the layout changes. Use with caution.

.TP
.BI "-n, --shortcuts.next-layout" "shortcut"
Shortcut to switch to next layout.

.SH SHORTCUTS

For switching between groups application uses default X11 configuration. For switching between
layouts you should define a shortcut by \fB-n, --shortcuts.next-layout\fR. You can use modifiers
"Ctrl", "Alt", "Meta" and "Shift" (or their combination) with any symbol key.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

To avoid typing the same options every time you can use configuration file
(from \fB--settings\fR option) in combination with CLI parameters
(CLI takes precedence over the configuration file). Settings uses
INI file \fIhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\fR syntax and contains the same options as
in \fBConfiguration\fR section. So, \fBgeneral.layouts\fR defines \fB[general]\fR section and
\fBlayouts\fR value.

.B For example:
.RS
[general]
.br
print-groups=true
.br
layouts=en,ru en,ua
.br

[shortcuts]
.br
next-layout=Ctrl+Alt+F
.RE

.B Equivalent to:
.RS
akd -p -l en,ru en,ua -n Ctrl+Alt+F
